      James Payton is a detective, on an undercover operation where fake passports are being smuggled into Atlanta by a man named "Omar". After a shootout with the smugglers, and a car chase that leads one injured, the lieutenant leading the case ask James to drop the case on "Omar", something James doesn't.

Ben Barber , a fast-talking, jumpy high school security guard, applies for the Atlanta City Police Academy. So when he gets in, he decides to ask James for his blessings to marry his sister Angela. James then says Ben has to be worthy of Angela, making him go on a "ride along" to prove it.
